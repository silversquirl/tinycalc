# tinycalc

tinycalc is a calculator. A tiny one. No, really; it's less than 30
lines of code.

tinycalc started as an experiment to play around with
[TinyExpr][tinyexpr]. It then evolved into a little calculator that I
actually use. I used to use Python for calculations, now I use tinycalc.

tinycalc is written in pure C. It uses [Linenoise][linenoise] for line
editing and [TinyExpr][tinyexpr] for evaluating mathematical
expressions.
